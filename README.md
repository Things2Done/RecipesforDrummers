Things I wanted to do and could not accomplish:

Graphic Design - 
I wanted to make a octopus with eight drumstics, one in each arm, I could not get the AI drawing tools 
to do this.

Animation:
1. I wanted to make the individual drum stick move like it was hitting a drum, but could not figure out moving a segment of an image or how to subdivide the image effectively 
2. I wanted to cycle through the left column of videos first then flip the octopus once and cycle through all the right columns of videos, I was unable to keep the item flipped to the side

Instead I flipped each row because that seemed like something I could accomplish

Only single video appeared at a time-
I wanted to block out every video that the octopus was not pointing but have not yet figured this out.

I also have been unable to keep the page to the size of the screen and need more assistance on that.
